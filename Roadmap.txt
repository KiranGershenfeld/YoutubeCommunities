Youtube Mapping Project

Goal: Create a map of youtube similar to my map of twitch

Step 1:
Get a list of youtube channels to include in the map
    * Done but im not sure that the channel list is really gonna accomplish the goal -- Will have to see
    * Update: Channel list for sure sucks but it will be a suitable prototype
    * New plan is to just dump $200 into social blade api its really not that much money and im gonna run a demo
        to hopefully ensure that the process is gonna work i really hope it works

Step 2:
Get the 10 most recent videos from each of their channels
*May rework this to depend on # of commenters, probably like 50k per channel

Step 3:
Get the commenters from each of those videos

Step 4:
Save the dictionary {Channel: [Commenters]} to some type of file or database

Step 5:
Run the same overlap calculator as for the twitch maps

Step 6:
Import the generated files into Gephi and see if the results are any good
