# YoutubeCommunities
 This project aims to visualize the Youtube creator ecosystem in a way that feels intuitive to Youtube users and Youtube creators. Due to API quota restrictions, the data collection process is ongoing. I currently have about 3,600 of the most subscribed Youtube Channels included with the goal being around ~5,000. 
 
I am aiming to complete this project by the end of October 2021

This project is in now way affiliated with Youtube and is simply a passion project by a curious student.
