# YoutubeCommunities
 This project aims to visualize the Youtube creator ecosystem in a way that feels intuitive to Youtube users and Youtube creators. Due to API quota restrictions, the data collection process is ongoing. I currently have about 3,600 of the most subscribed Youtube Channels included with the goal being around ~5,000. 
  
A Prototype of the full version is available now on https://youtubeatlas.com. It may take a minute or two to load. If you encounter severe issues with this website please let me know as that is somewhat new territory for me. Thanks!

This project is in now way affiliated with Youtube and is simply a passion project by a curious student.
