# YoutubeCommunities
 This project aims to recreate the visual map of Twitch seen in the my VisualizingTwitchCommunities repository. Due to API quota restrictions, the data collection process is ongoing. I currently have about 1,600 of the most subscribed Youtube Channels included with the goal being around ~5,000.
